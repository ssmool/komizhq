**KomizHQ** is a Python-based orchestration toolkit designed for engineers working with RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) and Gen-AI pipelines for automated comic creation and visual storytelling.

It combines cartoonization of images, comic-style layout generation, and dynamic text/dialogue composition to enable fast authoring of graphic stories and visual art using `.cckmz` package pipelines. A built-in server module also supports remote orchestration for online operations.
